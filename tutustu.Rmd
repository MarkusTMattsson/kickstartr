Getting to know your data
============================

Here we list some simple ways of getting acquainted with new data.

Let's first list built-in datasets:

```{r}
data()
```

And then pick one of the datasets:
```{r}
data(attitude)
```

What variables are in there?

```{r}
names(attitude)
```

How large is the data?
```{r}
dim(attitude)
```
How does the data begin and end:
```{r}
head(attitude)
tail(attitude)
```
View data:
```{r}
View(attitude)
```

Summarise data:

```{r}
summary(attitude)
```

For built-in daasets, there's also further info on them:

```{r}
?attitude
```

What are the variable types in our data?
```{r}
str(attitude)
```

OK, the variables are all percentages, stored in numerical form - so we can use boxplots easily

```{r}
boxplot(attitude)
```

A scatterplot matrix is also very easy to produce:
```{r}
plot(attitude)
```
