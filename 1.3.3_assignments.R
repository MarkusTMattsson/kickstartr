# Exercises
#

#####
# 1) Load dataset sleep from the R dataset repository using command data(sleep).
#    Get accustomed to the data. 

#####
# 2) Create different kinds of plots, using both boxplot and ggplot2, to describe the
# differences between the two drugs. 

######
# 3) Test the difference between the two drugs to extra hours of sleep using 
# Student's paired t-test.

### 
# 4) The data is in long format. Reshape the data to wide format, so the two observations
# from the same participant (denoted with variable group) are on their own variables. 

###
# 5) Create a scatter plot where the extra hours for drug 1 are on the x-axis, and
# the extra hours for drug 2 are on the y-axis. 


###
# 6) Load again the situation awareness data. Include the information about the set. 
#
# The design of the experiment was switching replications. Half of the participants 
# had an intervention between sets 1 and 2, and half between sets 2 and 3, 
#
# Therefore, we should have a significant interaction of variables set and test_order, if
# the intervention had any effect. 
#
# First, make a plot of the interaction using ggplot2. 



# 7) Perform repeated measures ANOVA to test the interaction. This can be performed using 
# function ezANOVA from package ez. 

# 8) Refresh you memories from previous stat courses. Is everything right the repeaated 
# measures ANOVA? Are we breaking any assumptions?
